h2. Overview

pygs is a wrapper for "libqxt's":http://www.libqxt.org/ "QxtGlobalShortcut":http://doc.libqxt.org/tip/qxtglobalshortcut.html.

My aim is to provide cross-platform support for global hotkeys (shortcuts) in python using PyQt4. Ideally I would like to remove the PyQt4 and libqxt dependency but that remains a future goal.
