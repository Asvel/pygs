h2. Overview

pygs provides cross-platform global hotkey / shortcuts for python using PyQt.

pygs is a wrapper for "libqxt's":http://www.libqxt.org/ "QxtGlobalShortcut":http://doc.libqxt.org/tip/qxtglobalshortcut.html.

My aim is to provide cross-platform support for global hotkeys (shortcuts) in python. Ideally I would like to remove the PyQt and libqxt dependency but that remains a (distant) future goal. I believe it is definitely possible and potentially quite useful though.

This fork support PyQt4 / PyQt5 on Python 2.&#120; / 3.&#120;.


h2. Installation

*Requirements*
~sufficient not necessary~

To Install

@setup.py install@


h2. Usage

NOTE: Ctrl maps to COMMAND on macs!!!! Yeah this is crazy confusing. But it's Qt not me :)
